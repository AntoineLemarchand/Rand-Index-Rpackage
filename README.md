# R Index for comparing cluster functions
This package has been created as a project for the university of Rennes 2 by 4 student in statistics.

## Purpose
This package aims to create clusters from a dataframe using different methods 
and compare them using two types of index.

## How it works
To create clusters from a dataframe, use the function :
> clustering(dataframe, numberofgroups)
Then to compare two methods you can use :
> jaccard(df, method1, method2)

Or

> rand(df, method1, method2)
